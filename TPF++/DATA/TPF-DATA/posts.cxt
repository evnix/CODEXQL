<br />
A sub-20k PHP simple Forum. Users can create new groups, topics and threads and reply to other threads. Wiki-like. Database free, TinyPHPForum   uses Flat files only. Foolproof, easy, quick, tiny. No advanced features.<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, now we're up to 163K unzipped (inc a few avatars and 11K of manuals and changelogs), but the concept is the same. The original was comical in its basic-ness - I had just learnt PHP when I created it. Still, there was interest, so I finally got around to updating it, as I need a forum for a new website of mine anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have re-written the whole thing from the original version, so it is incompatible 100%.<br />
<br />
<div class='quote'>The above statements are from the original author of TPF<br />
The version you are using is TPF++ vBeta <br />
it has a completely different core from the original TPF<br />
</div><br />
<br />
<br />
The latest versions include the following new features:<br />
<br />
* User accounts with nice pictures and passwords, upload avatars<br />
* Admin account facility (delete, edit, split things)<br />
* Emoticons <img src='emoticons/smile.gif'><br />
* Rich text-ish in posting - text italic link etc<br />
* Ability to edit posts, forums, topics<br />
* Search<br />
* Memberlists<br />
* Skinnable (and easy!)<br />
* Multi-language skins<br />
<br />
The following features have been retained:<br />
<br />
* Small(ish) certainly smaller than PHPBB etc<br />
* Database free - it is still 100% flat file based<br />
<br />
More to come.<br />
<br />
For suggestions etc, email me at address at bottom of page.<br />
