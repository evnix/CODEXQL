Finally, keeping a log of changes:

3-Jun-04 - v2.1

Worked on pofiles some more.  Can now edit your own profile.  Still need to 
add facility to create or merely view a profile.
You can upload avatars now, or choose from gallery.  Pretty neat, this.

Permissions.  Had to set various areas to 777 to allow writing of files etc 
by the forum.  When forums, users, etc are created by the forum itself, 
this isn't required, but uploading pre-existing data from a PC produces 
errors otherwise when trying to update it.  Not really a problem.
I think...


4-Jun-04

Changed the look of the forum list and topic list pages - added a table which 
is controlled by the CSS file.  There are spaces for last post, and poster now.

Fixed some bugs with create new user - reporting non-matching password due to 
re-use of a var name in the code.

Added check to dimension size of uploaded images - they cannot exceed 120 pixels
in height or width now.  Better.

Checked that we can't create users with html in the name.


10-Jun-04

Added the 'last post' and 'last poster' fields in the forum view and topic view.
Every time a new post if made, the lastpost.txt file is updated to contain the
name of the new user, and the datestamp of this is the last post date/time.


11-Jun-04

Can now edit the ID number of the forums, which means you can change the order that 
they appear in on the title screen.

Also, topics are now sorted by datestamp, so posting in a topic brings it ot the top 
of the list.


18-Jun-04

Fixed some bugs in the profile and updatepf files.  You could have a null username, or
null password before.  Now resolved.

Added a line for users to enter some text, quote, URL, whatever, in the profile section.
This is displayed under the user's avatar whenever shown.


19-Jun-04

Added membership list option in profile.php when called with action=all
(Must add admin function to this)


20-Jun-04

Fixed bug(s) on line 125+ in getdir, where I used $file (which didn't exist) instead of $files.


26-Jun-04

Altered profile files to include an admin checkbox.  Before, admin status was lost if you
edited your profile.  Still need to add feature to check the box if you are an admin already!

Altered rsort line in getdir to be conditional on $dirlist not being NULL, or an error can
be generated.


29-Jun-04

Error reported when uploading avatar:

Warning: move_uploaded_file(image/avatars/avatar.png): 
failed to open stream: Permission denied in 
/home/ralph/public_html/tpf/updatepf.php on line 54

This was due to permissions on the image/avatars folder.  They can be set to 777 to allow
uploads etc.  There are a few folders that require this upon installation, I will make
a list and put it in the mythical 'user manual'

Added an 'admin' user with password 'admin' to enable users to perform admin functions
right away, such as, make their own profile admin too!  They should delete or change
the password on the 'admin' account after creating their own admin account, or, at least,
change the password of the admin account to something more secure.

Written first version of user manual.

[later]

Added search.php file, which takes care of searching.  It is recursive and works
on multi-word inputs.  Listing are proved with a summary of the correct post in the
topic, and a link to it.  Lovely.

Fixed the bug where profiles that are admin, when edited, lose the checked admin
box, so often the admin status is lost.  Now if the profile is admin, it has a
checked box when you edit it.

Added a line in getdir.php to ensure that forums and posts are sorted before display, 
otherwise you are at the mercy of the filesystem and the order it retrieves them!


6th July 2004

So many changes, where to begin?

Complete change of makeup of php files.  Split into modules now - header, menu, body, config, etc.
The config.php file contains website url, email, title and skin settings, so easy to change now.

Skins should come think and fast now and will be as simple as unzipping the files into your forum
folder and changing your config file.

The css and layout have undergone radical changes, thanks to Laurent Baumann, email details in 
the config.php file if you wish to contact him concerning design work, skins etc.

Perhaps we'll see the ability for users to select what skin they want, as it is possible to 
have many installed at once without clashes!

Skinning manual will come out soon for those of you anxious to customise your forum and email 
me your designs to be uploaded onto sourceforge.net!

We're now also less than 100K for zip file size!!

Feedback as usual please...

[later]

Changed all gfx to gif, it makes sense.

Altered index, menu, formathelp to reflect this change.

Added skinpic.gif to images folder for formathelp.php.

[later]

Fixed a lot of css and html errors that were pointed out to me.  Also changed the table
format of the whole thing to allow more flexibility when skinning.  Now we have a nice 
2 x 3 table, which allows a logo, picture top right, main body, menu, then a bottom bar.

[later]

Added last post link with gfx to forum and topic list pages.

Added a nice mini-bagpuss picture above the menu, for no reason.  I'll probably have to 
remove it due to copyright issues at some point...

Fiddled with some files and css.

7th July 2004

Added error.php to handle all errors in a nice fashion.  It also contains a routine to
reset your password and email it to you.  I'll have to think about this, as it could
be abused by people reseting other user's passwords.

Also changed a bug where $siteName was not being displayed in the title of webpages,
now it is, and it is much better.

[later]

Added an admin function to split a topic at a certain point.  The posts from that point
are copied into a new topic, which can then be renamed.  I haven't included a function 
to move to a new forum.  Perhaps sometime in the future, but it is more complex...
New file added - split.php.

[later]

Delete user option now in place for admin users.

Updated search.php to match rest of forum.

Added view counter for topics.  Each time you view a topic, its counter is incremented.
I'm confused about locking though, please, anyone who likes, take a look at function hitme()
in index.php, and let me know.  If the lock comes after the write, it returns false and
doesn't write the new counter value...  Any ideas?!

8th July 2004

Added 'headline' topics, which means that if you prefix a topic name with '!' it will
appear at the top if the topic list, and have a little picture next to it (skinheadline.gif),
much like 'sticky' posts, or announcements.

Fixed some HTML errors to make us more HTML compliant.

Changed guest posting error message to be more in-line with theme.

Tidied up forums and accounts that come with the zip package.

[later]

Fixed a large bug in action.php:

----  if ($f2>0 & $f2!=$f) 

Which used to have the variable $fid2 in it, which didn't exist!  This caused an error when 
editing forum details.

Changed the topic hit counter to create a hit file if none exists, so we'll start to see
view counts on existing topics now...

[later]

Unexpcted bug meant that after each view, the topic dir got modified, so it shuffled to the 
top of the topic list!  Not good.  So, now we read the date of lastpost.txt for our ordering, 
and it works fine..  Phew.

Also fixed the problems with ' and accented chars being translated properly.  I think!


9th July 2004

All images now appear only in css file defs.  The only exceptions are:

Last post icon. lastpost.gif
Edit icon. edit.gif
Split icon. split.gif
Headline icon. headline.gif (but is not displayed if it does not exist)
Logo. log.gif (but is not displayed if it does not exist)
Pic.gif from the formathelp.php file
Emoticons

There are now 11 image files asociated with the forum.  Check tpf/ for the list.

Removed some css entities that aren't used.  Check tpf/style.css for latest.

Tidied all code up, added more comments, made it look nice when you view source in 
a browser - this helps when debugging.

Removed mentop entity from css file, and made first row of main page table
span two columns.

Added filler bar at bottom of listings, as suggested.

A bug is that with some logos, MS IE 6.0 displays some profile.php pages incorrectly.
I cannot establish why this is so, it seems to occur with large logo.gif files.  I 
cannot duplicate this in other browsers.  Bloody IE...

Added new column to display number of times a topic has been viewed.  This has added 
two more elements to the css file.

There seem to be a number of css elements in other skins that aren't referenced by 
the forum pages.  If new elements are added and used, this should be documented.  Use
tpf/style.css as a template and document changes from that please.


12th July 2004

Added author to topic view, for thread starter.

Added number of posts per user, held in users/username.hits

Added flag in config.php to block site to unregistered users.

Added avatargallery.php to view uploaded avatars.


13th July 2004

Updated profile.php memberlist screen, as I didn't like it.


14th July 2004

** Security fix - by altering $f $t and $p values, guests and no admin users could
perform various admin tasks.  This was due to lack of $admin checking in action.php.
Now fixed.

Added multi-lang support to all files.

[later]

Fixed a lot of lang errors - missing places where English was written.

Added German provided by Mirko Gräfen.

Changed $title and $siteName confusion in html.

Changed some html formatting.


15th July 2004

Fixed a number of bugs and language issues, but not all of them. Hence the .05 version increase.

Have added a nice option for users all to have different languages though...

Various fixes on skins, language etc.

Also added (admin) for admin users on posts.

Various other html move arounds.

[later]

Add ability for users to select own skin too...

[later]

Removed 'edited by' text from action.php, and the include line for the lang_ file.
This caused PHP sometimes to think that it couldn't re-direct as the UTF included
file was echoing invisible chars to the screen!


16th July

Added time stamp to posts.

Changed proile.php to include some lang trans I had missed.

Search.php changed to include author of matching topic.

[later]

Added $hitcouner flag for main page.  Set in config.php  Allows a main index page
hit counter - always nice to see!


19th July

Removed line in updatepf.php that prevented uploads!

Removed indexhits.txt from forum folder, which gave permission errors!

[later]

Updated avatar gallery config file order, this resolves skins not being used properly.

Updated config file order in split.php, which caused errors when used.

I replaced ' with &#39; in files that are read in and displayed... The reason?
I had statements like this:
echo "<input [...] value='".$text."'>";
But if text contains 's then the output html can look like this:
<input [...] value='Ralph's Apostrophe's Bad Day'>
Which, as we can see, isn't good... But with the replacement, it now reads:
<input [...] value='Ralph&#39;s Apostrophe&#39;s Bad Day'>
(Changes in index.php and profile.php)


20th July

Added user-on-line feature, which is a footprint file in users dir for each 
user when 'touching files' it is written with current date.  When the file is 
a minute out of date, it is deleted, so the user vanishes from the on-line-list.

Fixed bug in error.php which mean blank emails were being sent to people.


28th July 2004

[done] * Check admin logoff on IE browsers - domain and path in cookie may cause the problem. [Can't duplicate this error on IE 6.0 - Ralph]
[done] * Add file_get_contents() alternative for earlier users of PHP [Changed to implode(file($f)); - Ralph]
[done] * For Frontpage users - "_vti_cnf" should be excluded from forum dir list [Ralph]
[done] * Check bitwise operator & where should be && in index.php [Ralph]
[done] * Check $avatar=$_POST["avatar"]; in updatepf.php [added line, where did it go?! - Ralph]
[done] * Change cookie timout [Now set in config.php]
[done] * Display the lang of user in the members list? [Also skin]
[done] * Try and get rid of 'warnings' on systems set to error_reporting E_ALL [Ralph]


29 July 2004

Updated cookie security logon to include a session id which is checked against an md5
version on the server.  Otherwise, users could edit the cookie data and log on as whoever
they liked!


3rd August 2004

 modified showPosts() to add a td with edit and split options
 modified placement of "edit" option in list of forums and list of post
 removed style on "a" element and done a class for each different link (lot of them already exist)
in fact every 'a.something' inherit from the 'a' class so if you define a padding or something in a it's really annoying for all other links, so the default class is now 'link' (amazing !)
 changed <a id="bot"></a> for <tr><td><a id="bot"></a></td></tr> cause nothing can exist between a </tr> and a <tr>
 removed some style on the footer row, writed inline (we have to use css at maximum for skinning purpose)
 changed links for CSS and HTML validation (no javascript anymore)
 changed bug in "link" class in post 
 removed a.topic class (not used anywhere)
 commented the style.css
- Changed: $files = implode("",file($f)); in getdir.php for old php users

5th August

-- Fixed html validation bugs.
-- Fixed search.php link bugs.

1st Sept

* Just a few typos and minor bugs, as detailed on the forum website.  
Not a lot of work done lately on the forum, as I haven't had the time.

29th August 2006

Fixed the rest of the '|'s and '&'s in some if-clauses. Checking of valid forum 
and topic names added.

28th Sept

Now every script uses PHP sessions: it prevents the most used XSS (Cross Site
Scripting) attacks. Fixed some unlocalized texts in Edit Topic form and in
other parts of the admin screens.

30th May 2009
OH 2006-2009(No Updates Since){Iam Not Ralph[The original creator]}
My Name is Rosh Silva (U.K)[19 years after three days from 30/05/2009] 
When i Downloaded this forum.It was using a hell lot of resources
* Even when the index.php used to load ,it had to go through almost each and every directory
and file
* It did not look slow, but when the forum reached 100 topics, you could feel the difference
* There was no pagination 
* data was stored in multiple flat files.It was very hardware expensive(think about the no of disk seeks)
* so i thought of doing a little cleaning!

------HOPEFULLY RALPH DOESN'T MIND 

***Here are the changes:
--This Forum now works only with PHP 5.0 or higher
--Used a new Data Engine(CODEXQL) to store Data into FLAT FILES
--SQL like Syntax to insert, update and retrieve data
--Added Pagination Feature For Topics
--Changed The Resource intensive Search Feature
--Removed The Split Feature(will be added in the next version(1.0) as a MOD)
--Renamed TPF 3.61 to TPF++ vBeta (LOL since,the whole internal working of the forum has changed)
--Cleaned Some Old Bugs
--TPF++ is now being tested under "E_STRICT|E_NOTICE|E_WARNING|E_PARSE" Conditions
--Uploaded images will have unique names(so no more rewriting of older images)
--Most of the outer structure hasn't been touched like skins,lang,hits,sid etc.
--It will Still require the "forums" and the "users" folder to store hits and onlines
--I was a little curious about the ICO file,so i changed it(since users will have their own ICO anyway)
--Most of the older code is just commented out 

***Changes Thought for the next version (TPF++ v1.0)
-to completely use sessions and remove cookies
-add pagination for posts
-change search from strpos to more powerfull REGEX
-add module capabilities as in PHPBB or SMF
-add WYSIWYG editor
-add a real templating/skin mechanism (Probably use Smarty)

##inspite of the heavy changes in the next version we will maintain total backward compatibility
  you only have to replace the "DATA" folder with your older one and you'll have a new version
